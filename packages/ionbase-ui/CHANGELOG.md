## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-31

### Breaking — the package no longer loads any webfonts

`dist/styles/index.css` opened with a Google Fonts `@import`. It has been
removed. **Apps relying on that implicit load must now load the fonts
themselves**, or fall back to the generic families (see below).

This is a fix as much as a break: the implicit load already failed for anyone
using a bundler, which is most consumers. CSS requires `@import` to precede all
other rules, and a bundler that concatenates stylesheets puts other rules ahead
of it, so the browser dropped it silently. Confirmed in a Next.js 16 /
Turbopack app — the built bundle contained no `@import` and no
`fonts.googleapis` string at all, so no font ever loaded.

Font delivery belongs to the consuming app, which knows whether it wants
`next/font`, Fontsource, self-hosted `@font-face` or a corporate CDN. It is
also not a design system's place to open a render-blocking request to a
third party, bypass `next/font`, and hand visitor IPs to Google on the
consumer's behalf.

**Before** — fonts arrived (or appeared to) with the stylesheet:

```tsx
import 'ionbase-ui/styles';
```

**After** — load the three families your UI actually uses. With `next/font`:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { Host_Grotesk, Merriweather, STIX_Two_Text } from 'next/font/google';
import 'ionbase-ui/styles';
import './ionbase-fonts.css'; // must come after, so it wins

const sans = Host_Grotesk({ subsets: ['latin'], variable: '--app-sans' });
const display = STIX_Two_Text({
  subsets: ['latin'],
  variable: '--app-display',
});
const serif = Merriweather({
  subsets: ['latin'],
  weight: ['700'],
  variable: '--app-serif',
});

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html
      lang="en"
      className={`${sans.variable} ${display.variable} ${serif.variable}`}
    >
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

```css
/* ionbase-fonts.css */
:root {
  --font-family-sans: var(--app-sans), system-ui, sans-serif;
  --font-family-serif-display: var(--app-display), Georgia, serif;
  --font-family-serif: var(--app-serif), Georgia, serif;
}
```

Self-hosting needs no token override at all — the tokens already name these
families, so a matching `@font-face` is picked up automatically. Full guidance,
including the weights each family needs, is in the README under "Fonts".

### Fixed — font tokens carry generic fallbacks

Font tokens named bare families:

```css
--font-family-sans: Host Grotesk;
```

So when the webfonts did not load, the families resolved to nothing and text
fell through to the browser default — a serif. The symptom read as a token bug
rather than a font-loading one, which is what made it slow to diagnose. Tokens
now end in the right generic:

```css
--font-family-sans:
  'Host Grotesk', system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif;
--font-family-serif: Merriweather, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;
--font-family-serif-display: 'STIX Two Text', Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;
--font-family-mono:
  'Space Mono', ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, monospace;
```

An app that loads no fonts now renders in the platform UI font with serif
headings: still wrong, but wrong in the right category and legible.

The stacks live in `token-overrides.json`, not in Figma — a Figma font variable
holds one real family it has to be able to render. The CSS build fails if any
family lacks a stack, so a new font in Figma cannot ship bare.

## 0.1.1

### Fixed — React Aria props no longer reach the DOM

`Button` spread its leftover props onto `<button>`, so `onPress` and the rest of
the React Aria surface hit the DOM. React logged "Unknown event handler property
`onPress`. It will be ignored." on every render. Handlers always fired —
`useButton` receives the full props object — so the leak was the only defect.

Dropped from the spread: `onPress`, `onPressStart`, `onPressEnd`,
`onPressChange`, `onPressUp`, `onFocusChange`, `excludeFromTabOrder`,
`preventFocusOnPress`, `elementType`, `href`, `target`, `rel`. The list is
derived from `AriaButtonProps` at compile time rather than hand-maintained.

### Removed — the `./src/*` export subpath

It could not resolve for anyone installing from npm, because `src/` is not in
`files`. Nothing that worked at 0.1.0 stopped working.

## 0.1.0

First release.
